# TextVR
 A Large Cross-Modal Video Retrieval Dataset with Reading Comprehension

## Get Started
 ### Environment Setup
 TextVR is based on the video retrieval model [
frozen-in-time](https://github.com/m-bain/frozen-in-time). To setup the environment of TextVR, we use `conda` to manage our dependencies. Our developers use `CUDA 11.1` to do experiments. You can specify the appropriate `cudatoolkit` version to install on your machine in the `requirements.txt` file, and then run the following commands to install FlowText:
 ```
conda create -n textvr python=3.8
conda activate textvr

pip install torch==1.9.0+cu111 torchvision==0.10.0+cu111 torchaudio==0.9.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

git clone https://github.com/callsys/TextVR
cd TextVR
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
### Download Dataset and Model
To run TextVR, you need to download some files, which mainly contain the dataset, the pretrained model. Once you have downloaded the files, link them to the TextVR directory:
```
ln -s path/to/TextVR_data TextVR/data
ln -s path/to/TextVR_ckpt TextVR/ckpt
```
### Running TextVR
Training TextVR with given config file `configs/TextVR_fusion.json`:
```
python train.py -c configs/TextVR_fusion.json
```
Inference TextVR with given weights `ckpt/textvr.pth` and save the similarity matrix `textvr.npy`:
```
python test.py -c configs/TextVR_fusion.json -r ckpt/textvr.pth --sim_path textvr.npy
```
`textvr.npy` is a ndarray S of shape 2727x2727 (2727 is the size of the test set), where S[x, y] denotes the similarity score between the x-th caption and y-th video. Note that the caption of the test set has been scrambled so that the model cannot be validated offline. If you want to verify a model's performance on the test set, submit the similarity matrix `ckpt/textvr.pth` to the competition website.
